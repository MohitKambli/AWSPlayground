Amazon EC2 is a service which allows you to create virtual machines or instances on AWS Cloud.
To create an EC2 instance, we need to implement the following steps:
  -> Give a name to your EC2 instance
  -> Depending which OS you want to work on, choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) accordingly
     There are a variety of AMIs to choose from
     These can be Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, MacOS, RedHat, SUSE Linux
     We can also select the architecture that we would like to work on (x86 / arm)
  -> Select an Instance Type based on he requirements
     These instance types can be selected based on the memory/CPU/Family factors
  -> Create a Key Pair for login
     We need to generate a Key Pair Login by giving a name to it, selecting its type (RSA/ED25519), choosing key file format (pem/ppk) and simply create it
  -> Configure Network Settings by creating/choosing security group and then define rules on these groups (allowing ssh/https/http traffic)
  -> Configure Storage based on the requirements (RAM & ROM)
  -> Review the summary and simply launch the instance
