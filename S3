Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service
For quick access speed and support to thousands of request per second, the data object is stored in the form of buckets
We can have multiple buckets in which the data object would be stored
Bucket limit on an AWS account is 100
Bucket name should be unique globally
In order to create a bucket:
  -> Select a unique name for your bucket
  -> Choose the AWS region in which your bucket needs to be placed
  -> Configure Access Control List
  -> Configure Bucket Versioning
  -> Select Encryption
  -> Configure Properties/Permissions for the bucket
  -> While deleting an S3 bucket, first delete all the objects within that bucket and then delete the bucket
