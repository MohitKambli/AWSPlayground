AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service
This service allows you to write your own functions in multiple supported languages like Java, Python, NodeJS, etc
Once these functions have been implemented, these are deployed on machines managed by AWS
Serverless doesn't mean having no servers, but it means that we don't have to worry about the management of servers which this function would be running on
For example in EC2, we have to configure and manage the memory, storage and other parameters for our EC2 instance
In case of Lambda, we don't have to do anything like this
We simply need to write a function and deploy it
Lambda will handle the traffic on this function by scaling its server as required
Since all the task of managing a server/instance is nullified, this is called a serverless AWS service
Based on the trigger configured, when that particular trigger is invoked, the function gets executed
