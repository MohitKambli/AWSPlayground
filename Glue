AWS Glue is an ETL service which is fully managed by AWS
Two main features of AWS Glue:
  -> Data Catalog: Metadata (Schema of Data, Location, etc.) of the data, stored in a variety data sources like S3/DynamoDB/RDS, can be stored in AWS Glue Catalog
       1) Database: Logical database (Not a physical database) that stores metadata tables
       2) Tables: Logical table (Not a physical table) that contains metadata of the data stored in various data sources
       3) Crawlers: Program that connects to data source, scans data in data source to determine its schema and creates metadata tables in Data Catalog
       4) Connections: Configuration object that enables Glue to connect to your/various data stores
  -> ETL Engine: Used to visualize, run and monitor ETL pipelines
       1) ETL Jobs: Transforms the extracted/source data and then puts in the loaded/destination data
       2) Triggers: Events that can start your ETL jobs (Event based / Schedule based)

Once a table is created in data catalog, we can query that particular data using AWS Athena
